#Study design
Here is description of raw data which were the base of this data set:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This data set contains "-mean()" and "-std()" variables from the raw data set with some names improvements. Which may be found at Readme.md. Their amount is 66.
Two additional variables where computed from raw data and added to this data set under names "subject" and "activity".

* subject - variable which contains an id of a person who participated in the experiment described by link in Study design section. Their range is from 1 to 30.
* activity - variable which contains name of an activity performed by subject. There are 6 activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
